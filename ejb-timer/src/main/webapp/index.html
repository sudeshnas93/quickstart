        <h1>Hello There! Welcome to WildFly!</h1>
        <h2>The ejb-timer Quickstart has been deployed and running successfully.</h2>
    	  <h2>What is ejb-timer quickstart?</h2>
    	  <p>
    	      The <i>ejb-timer</i> quickstart demonstrates how to use the EJB timer service in WildFly.
            It creates a timer service that uses the <b>@Schedule</b> and <b>@Timeout</b> annotations.

        <h2>Access the Application</h2>
        <p>
            This example application is not intended to be opened in a browser.
            Instead, the EJB timer service outputs messages to the WildFly server console.
            View the EJB timer message in the WildFly server log or Console window.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>
            Additional information can be found in the README file at the root of this quickstart directory.
